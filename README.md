# Kaggle-Survey-2020

This is that time of the year when Kaggle shares data from its industry-wide survey on its platform and challenges the Data Scientists all over the world to analyze that data and present a truly comprehensive view on the current state of data science and machine learning. Ergo, as a fellow data scientist, after looking at the dataset, I felt that it will be a nice exercise to know more about the patterns in the community.
In order to make this analysis, a bit more easy to read, I have divided it into a series of articles:
Part 1 : What is the data science communityâ€™s favourite media source? [https://towardsdatascience.com/whats-data-science-community-s-favourite-media-source-18a2c5e91bc6] 
Part 2 : Most Popular Machine Learning Tools and Algorithms
Part 3 : What's more popular Google Colab , Kaggle Kernels or Jupyter Notebooks?
Part 4 : Current State of Machine Learning in Industry
